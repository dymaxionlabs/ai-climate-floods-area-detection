Floods are one of the most often climate disasters in Honduras, mainly in Sula Valley. The informal settlement's population is particularly vulnerable due to the low-quality building construction.

The development of the susceptible flooded area model will contribute to information generation, which will allow good public policies.
As inputs, the model uses: (I) a raster dataset from optical satellites that represent conditioning factors (topographic and environmental) that can facilitate flood occurrence, (II)georeferenced information (ground truth) of flood past events.

DEM, slope, topographic wet index (TWI), land use and land cover (LULC), NDVI map, and distance to rivers and roads are the conditioning factors used in the input dataset.
The selection of these factors has depended on the area of interest characteristics and the availability of the data.
